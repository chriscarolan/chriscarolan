# Hello! I am Christopher Carolan


I am the most interesting in learning data science and analytical techniques such as machine learning, deep learning, and data visualization. I specialize in working with Python and R, but would love to learn more about languages such as Java and C++
I have recently been working on a project where I will predict the outcomes of college basketball games
Personally, I love playing and watching sports, with my favorite to play being basketball, while I love watching baseball and basketball the most. 
I also really enjoy hanging out with my friends here at Marist, and have recently been trying to learn how to cook!
